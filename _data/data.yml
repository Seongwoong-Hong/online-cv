      Humans exhibit complex control mechanisms involving adaptive strategy selection in response to environmental changes.
      Explaining this adaptive process is essential for understanding and predicting the principles of human movement.
      This study aims to demonstrate that such control adaptation during upright postural control can be explained
      from the perspective of optimizing goals composed of relevant biomechanical elements. To this end, an optimization 
      objective function incorporating biomechanical constraints was established, and a control model was developed and
      trained with a reinforcement-learning algorithm. This model successfully reproduced the control transition,
      regulating ankle-hip strategy use according to perturbation magnitude. This demonstrates that adaptive strategy 
      selection can emerge from the optimization of relevant biomechanical elements in response to environmental changes. 
      Consequently, this study suggests that the control transition phenomenon observed in human systems, where appropriate 
      strategies are selected based on the external environment, can be explained as a process of optimizing biomechanical 
      goals and constraints.
